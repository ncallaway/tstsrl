## Building ##
To build and run the unit tests, you will need the [Google C++ Mocking Framework](http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/). This
framework is nice enough to come with the Google C++ Testing Framework, so you don't need to download the Testing Framework.

Download and extract to a folder named `gmock` and placed within this test directory. From the project root, you should have a folder like:

    test/gmock/include
    test/gmock/gtest/include
