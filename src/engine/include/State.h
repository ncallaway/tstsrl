/**
  The State class defines a game state that controls the game loop. Examples of States might be:

  - Menus
  - Gameplay
  - Loading Screens
 
  The State class defines two important components. **Lifecycle** methods and **Game loop** methods. The
  lifecycle methods are called at important times for the state: creation, transitioning, starting, stopping, etc.
  while the game loop methods are called once (or several) times for each iteration of the game loop while the
  state is active.
 
  All game loop methods return a boolean parameter that determines if the game should exit as a result of the
  call. Return true to exit the game loop, false to keep going. By default, all methods return false.
